# Web Application Project

This is a project to showcase some Flask capabilities, basic user interactions, nothing serious.
It is a sample website that will guide you towards choosing a phone, which features to take into consideration and other guidelines.
Database can be built using the [Scraper](https://www.github.com/mihai10001/scrap) I created, altough I don't encourage using it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specification for the project:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Languages used: Python, HTML, CSS, JS<br/>
Applications used: Flask, MongoDB, DataTables<br/>
Separate projects : [Scraper](https://www.github.com/mihai10001/scrap) for populating database<br/>


- A local Database, preferably using a NOSQL approach, and for which I chose MongoDB.<br/> (others include CouchDB, CouchBase, etc.)

- The application is held running on a local web deployment server called Flask, which I manage using Python.

- Dinamically generated web pages using Flask, based on the URL accesed or the requests I'm getting from the user.

- The database is populated by the scraper linked above.

- The data is being extracted from the database and sent trough Flask variables. Then, the data is presented in tables, and for that I chose DataTables. (easy to use plug-in to present your data)
